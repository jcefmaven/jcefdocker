...for Linux and Windows.

## How to use for your own builds
Head to the [jcefmaven/jcefbuild](https://github.com/jcefmaven/jcefbuild) repository
to use the repository itself as a template for your builds.
The [jcefmaven/jcefdocker](https://github.com/jcefmaven/jcefdocker) repository exists
only to upload prebuilt linux/i386, linux/amd64 and windows/amd64 (for 32 and 64 bit builds) to docker hub.
