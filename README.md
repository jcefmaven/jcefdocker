## How to use for your own builds
Head to the [jcefmaven/jcefbuild](https://github.com/jcefmaven/jcefbuild) repository
to use the repository itself as a template for your builds.
The [jcefmaven/jcefdocker](https://github.com/jcefmaven/jcefdocker) repository exists
only to upload prebuilt images for Linux and Windows to docker hub.
